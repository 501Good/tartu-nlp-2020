<b>                                      "PULP FICTION"
</b>
                                            By

                             Quentin Tarantino & Roger Avary

</b>
               PULP [pulp] n.

               1. A soft, moist, shapeless mass or matter.

               2. A magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and 
               being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.

               American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition

<b>               INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING
</b>
               A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. 
               It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, 
               there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching 
               on bacon and eating eggs.

               Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The 
               Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, 
               like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're 
               going out of style.

               It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or 
               how old she is; everything she does contradicts something 
               she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is 
               to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm 
                         through doin' that shit.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         You always say that, the same thing 
                         every time: never again, I'm through, 
                         too dangerous.

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I know that's what I always say. I'm 
                         always right too, but –

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         – but you forget about it in a day 
                         or two -

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         – yeah, well, the days of me 
                         forgittin' are over, and the days of 
                         me rememberin' have just begun.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         When you go on like this, you know 
                         what you sound like?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I sound like a sensible fucking man, 
                         is what I sound like.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         You sound like a duck.
                              (imitates a duck)
                         Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, 
                         quack, quack...

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         Well take heart, 'cause you're never 
                         gonna hafta hear it again. Because 
                         since I'm never gonna do it again, 
                         you're never gonna hafta hear me 
                         quack about how I'm never gonna do 
                         it again.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         After tonight.

               The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in 
               there, back and forth.

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                              (with a smile)
                         Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

               A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

<b>                                     WAITRESS
</b>                         Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         Oh yes, thank you.

               The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man 
               lights up another cigarette.

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I'm doin' fine.

               The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his 
               smoke.

               The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her 
               coffee.

               The Young Man goes right back into it.

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I mean the way it is now, you're 
                         takin' the same fuckin' risk as when 
                         you rob a bank. You take more of a 
                         risk. Banks are easier!  Federal 
                         banks aren't supposed to stop you 
                         anyway, during a robbery. They're 
                         insured, why should they care? You 
                         don't even need a gun in a federal 
                         bank. I heard about this guy, walked 
                         into a federal bank with a portable 
                         phone, handed the phone to the teller, 
                         the guy on the other end of the phone 
                         said: "We got this guy's little girl, 
                         and if you don't give him all your 
                         money, we're gonna kill 'er."

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         Did it work?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm 
                         talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in 
                         a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, 
                         not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, 
                         cleans the place out, and they don't 
                         lift a fuckin' finger.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         Did they hurt the little girl?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I don't know. There probably never 
                         was a little girl – the point of the 
                         story isn't the little girl. The 
                         point of the story is they robbed 
                         the bank with a telephone.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         You wanna rob banks?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, 
                         I'm just illustrating that if we 
                         did, it would be easier than what we 
                         been doin'.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         So you don't want to be a bank robber?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         Naw, all those guys are goin' down 
                         the same road, either dead or servin' 
                         twenty.

<b>                                     YOUNG WOMAN
</b>                         And no more liquor stores?

<b>                                     YOUNG MAN
</b>                         What have we been talking about? 
                         Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, 
                         it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too 
                         many foreigners own liquor stores. 
                         Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't 
                         fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:

</b>                         What's wrong with that? People never 
                         rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor 
                         stores, gas stations, you get your 
                         head blown off stickin' up one of 
                         them. Restaurants, on the other hand, 
                         you catch with their pants down. 
                         They're not expecting to get robbed, 
                         or not as expecting.

                         I bet in places like this you could 
                         cut down on the hero factor.

</b>                         Correct. Just like banks, these places 
                         are insured. The managers don't give 
                         a fuck, they're just tryin' to get 
                         ya out the door before you start 
                         pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget 
                         it, they ain't takin' a bullet for 
                         the register. Busboys, some wetback 
                         gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour 
                         gonna really give a fuck you're 
                         stealin' from the owner. Customers 
                         are sittin' there with food in their 
                         mouths, they don't know what's goin' 
                         on. One minute they're havin' a Denver 
                         omelet, next minute somebody's 
                         stickin' a gun in their face.

               The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man 
               continues in a low voice.

               The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new 
               information.

               She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The 
               tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the 
               motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the 
               COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's 
               face.

               And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, 
               stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona 
               is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is

               An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS 
               down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front

               wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long 
               green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES

                         it and, if you're the proprietor of 
                         a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. 
                         It's legal to carry it, which doesn't 
                         really matter 'cause – get a load of 
                         this – if the cops stop you, it's 
                         illegal for this to search you.

                         an invention called television, and 
                         on that invention they show shows?

</b>                         Well, the way they pick the shows on 
                         TV is they make one show, and that 
                         show's called a pilot. And they show 
                         that one show to the people who pick 
                         the shows, and on the strength of 
                         that one show, they decide if they 
                         want to make more shows. Some get 
                         accepted and become TV programs, and 
                         some don't, and become nothing. She 
                         starred in one of the ones that became 
                         nothing.

</b>
               THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a 
               table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

               One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to 
               REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

               The two men stroll inside.

               The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

               MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the 
               scene progresses, back into the corner.

               ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of 
               Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the 
               table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

               BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

               Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in 
               their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

               Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see 
               what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent

               Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,

               Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing 
               the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits 
               in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in 
               front of an interrogator.

                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of darkness, for he is 
                         truly his brother's keeper and the 
                         finder of lost children. And I will 
                         strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know my name 
                         is the Lord when I lay my vengeance 
                         upon you."

               The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting 
               Brett.

<b>               INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY
</b>
               Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 
               cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, 
               ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

<b>               EXT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY
</b>
               Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus 
               owns.

               Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking 
               lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

               Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, 
               revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. 
               Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin 
               Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally 
               LeRoy's.

<b>                                     ENGLISH DAVE

                         git your ass on in here.

               Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between 
               Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door 
               in our faces.

<b>               INT. SALLY LEROY'S – DAY
</b>
               The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave 
               crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

<b>                                     VINCENT
</b>                         Where's the big man?

</b>                         He's over there, finishing up some 
                         business.

               VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with 
               his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of 
               yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

                         when you see the white boy leave, go 
                         on over.  In the meanwhile, can I 
                         make you an espresso?

</b>                         Not yet.

               English Dave smiles to himself.

<b>                                     VINCENT
</b>                         What's so funny?

<b>                                     ENGLISH DAVE
</b>                         Not a goddamn thing.

<b>                                     VINCENT

                         man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit 
                         across a table, chew my food with my

                         that's all I'm gonna do.

               English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

               Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his 
               cup of "Plain ol' American."

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                              (to English Dave)

</b>                         Non.

               While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his 
               coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

<b>                                     BUTCH

               Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

<b>                                     VINCENT
</b>                         I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.

               Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

<b>                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
</b>                         Vincent Vega has entered the building, 
                         git your ass over here!

               Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another 
               glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME, 
               looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching 
               business.

               BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure 
               that is Marsellus.

               of Marsellus, he better let it go – for now.

               Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen

               at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

               That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it 
               makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent 
               to ponder the truth of her statement.

               appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly

               has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a 
               "Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

               Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

               Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

</b>
               In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over 
               L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're 
               all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, 
               Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, 
               saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the 
               Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and 
               over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

               But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's 
               diners.

               Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of 
               view.

               Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with 
               a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a 
               red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath 
               the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that 
               is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

               Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on 
               the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

               Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint 
               English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over 
               the wall

<b>               ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF 
</b>               THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that 
               the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s 
               cars.

               In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign 
               on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers 
               (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or 
               barefeet.

               The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, 
               B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The 
               WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: 
               MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and 
               LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing 
               appropriate costumes.

               Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red 
               '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting 
               a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing 
               you please me."

               Buddy exits.

               Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are 
               dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers, 
               and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing, 
               The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her 
               customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a 
               fool.

               Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling 
               himself a smoke.

               After a second of watching him –

               As he finishes licking it –

</b>                         You can have this one, cowgirl.

               He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to 
               her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's 
               hand. He lights it.

               He begins rolling one for himself.

               As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, 
               making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a 
               square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS 
               the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out 
               a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

               Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". 
               They make hand movements as they dance.

<b>               INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME – NIGHT
</b>
               The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-
               style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the 
               previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

               Then...

               The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

</b>                         Was than an uncomfortable silence?

</b>                         I don't know what that was.
                              (pause)
                         Music and drinks!

               Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his 
               overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

<b>                                     VINCENT
</b>                         I'm gonna take a piss.

<b>                                     MIA
</b>                         That was a little bit more information 
                         than I needed to know, but go right 
                         ahead.

               Vincent shuffles off to the john.

               Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs 
               and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high 
               energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She 
               dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's 
               overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It 
               feels good.

               Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. 
               Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco 
               on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks 
               the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a 
               little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so 
               anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out 
               his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, 
               trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you 
               know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly 
               brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, 
               then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

               The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she 
               takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in 
               the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something 
               else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder 
               inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. 
               Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her 
               face.

<b>               INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE) – NIGHT

               Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to 
               himself in the mirror.

                         goodbye, walk out the door, get in 
                         your car, and go down the road.

<b>               LIVING ROOM
</b>
               Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines 
               on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred 
               dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the 
               fat line.

<b>               CLOSEUP – MIA
</b>
               Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels 
               like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. 
               Then... the rush hits...

<b>               BATHROOM

               Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his 
               dialogue with the mirror.

</b>                         ...It's a moral test of yourself, 
                         whether or not you can maintain 
                         loyalty. Because when people are 
                         loyal to each other, that's very 
                         meaningful.

<b>               LIVING ROOM
</b>
               Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but 
               it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from 
               her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her 
               stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

<b>               BATHROOM
</b>
               Vince continues.

<b>                                     VINCENT
</b>                         So you're gonna go out there, drink 
                         your drink, say "Goodnight, I've had 
                         a very lovely evening," go home, and 
                         jack off.  And that's all you're 
                         gonna do.

               Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's 
               ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of 
               that door. So he goes through it.

<b>               LIVING ROOM
</b>
               We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to 
               the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like 
               a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are 
               down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the 
               tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her 
               face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open. 
               Slack-jawed.

</b>                         Jesus Christ!

               Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body. 
               Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck 
               to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

               Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

                         Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?

               But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles, 
               but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

               Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

<b>                                     VINCENT

                         me honey, what did you take?

               Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

               Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the 
               rack.

               He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent 
               makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

                         Okay honey, we're getting you on 
                         your feet.

               He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

                         go, watch us walk.

               We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-
               unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

               he glances over at Mia.

               Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag 
               of water.

               Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches

               out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,

               WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

               Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's 
               wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone 
               on it.

               through the hall into the living room.

               standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of 
               the room.

               From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a

               here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

               Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic 
               marker in her hand.

               Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes 
               a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

                         But she's got a breast plate in front 
                         of her heart, so you gotta pierce 
                         through that. So what you gotta do 
                         is bring the needle down in a stabbing 
                         motion.

               The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

               Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the 
               chest.

               Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

               The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline 
               out through the needle.

               Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of 
               the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck

               Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in

               Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of 
               air.

               The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken 
               to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

</b>                         This watch I got here was first 
                         purchased by your great-granddaddy. 
                         It was bought during the First World 
                         War in a little general store in 
                         Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought 
                         by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge 
                         the day he set sail for Paris. It 
                         was your great-granddaddy's war watch, 
                         made by the first company to ever 
                         make wrist watches. You see, up until 
                         then, people just carried pocket 
                         watches. Your great-granddaddy wore 
                         that watch every day he was in the 
                         war. Then when he had done his duty, 
                         he went home to your great-
                         grandmother, took the watch off his 
                         wrist and put it in an ol' coffee 
                         can. And in that can it stayed 'til 
                         your grandfather Dane Coolidge was 
                         called upon by his country to go 
                         overseas and fight the Germans once 
                         again. This time they called it World 
                         War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave 
                         it to your granddad for good luck.  
                         Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as 
                         good as his old man's. Your granddad 
                         was a Marine and he was killed with 
                         all the other Marines at the battle 
                         of Wake Island. Your granddad was 
                         facing death and he knew it. None of 
                         those boys had any illusions about 
                         ever leavin' that island alive. So 
                         three days before the Japanese took 
                         the island, your 22-year old 
                         grandfather asked a gunner on an Air 
                         Force transport named Winocki, a man 
                         he had never met before in his life, 
                         to deliver to his infant son, who he 
                         had never seen in the flesh, his 
                         gold watch. Three days later, your 
                         grandfather was dead. But Winocki 
                         kept his word. After the war was 
                         over, he paid a visit to your 
                         grandmother, delivering to your infant 
                         father, his Dad's gold watch. This 
                         watch. This watch was on your Daddy's 
                         wrist when he was shot down over 
                         Hanoi. He was captured and put in a 
                         Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew 
                         if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd 
                         be confiscated. The way your Daddy 
                         looked at it, that watch was your 
                         birthright. And he'd be damned if 
                         and slopeheads were gonna put their 
                         greasy yella hands on his boy's 
                         birthright. So he hid it in the one 
                         place he knew he could hide somethin'. 
                         His ass. Five long years, he wore 
                         this watch up his ass. Then when he 
                         died of dysentery, he gave me the 
                         watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk 
                         of metal up my ass for two years. 
                         Then, after seven years, I was sent 
                         home to my family. And now, little 
                         man, I give the watch to you.

               Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes 
               into FRAME to accept it.

               The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: 
               trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few 
               zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to 
               him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, 
               he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

               His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a 
               little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to 
               be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

               Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB 
               outside.

               He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch 
               hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him 
               on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH 
<b>               COOLIDGE".

               The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for 
               Butch.

               As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. 
               Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, 
               empty locker room.

               She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in 
               the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

               A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-
               side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage 
               dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed 
               in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to 
               the dumpster below.

               ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

               Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS 
               to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and 
               throws it to the ground.

               Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, 
               HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

               Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through

               shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave 
               takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by

               In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table – 
               dead.

               His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is 
               on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

               The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, 
               hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. 
               We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

               Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

               Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

               Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

               He takes a long drag.

               Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to 
               take him wherever he wants to go.

               Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain 
               has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out, 
               now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic 
               jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

               Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

               Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds 
               it out of reach.

               Butch enters and turns on the light.

               Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to 
               us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

               Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

               When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in 
               babytalk.

                         I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna

                         oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a 
                         woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The 
                         rest of you is normal. Normal face, 
                         normal legs, normal hips, normal 
                         ass, but with a big, perfectly round 
                         pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a 
                         tee-shirt two sizes too small to 
                         accentuate it.

                         attractive. It's unfortunate what we 
                         find pleasing to the touch and 
                         pleasing to the eye is seldom the

               Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in 
               the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We 
               see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow 
               her up.

               She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower 
               washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the 
               smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. 
               Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his 
               head out.

               Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the 
               bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still 
               wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

               ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking 
               on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

               Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing

               Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV 
               Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

                         blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, 
                         eggs over easy, and five sausages.

                         Anything to drink with that?

               Butch is finished dressing.

                         Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a

                         black cup of coffee. After that, I'm

               As he goes through the suitcase.

               Fabienne is crying and scared.

               Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more 
               menacing.

               Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

               Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the 
               motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

               Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

               Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

                         You left it at the apartment.

               He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

               He touches her hand, she flinches.

                         a bunch of stuff. I reminded you 
                         about it, but I didn't illustrate 
                         how personal the watch was to me. If

               He kisses her hand. Then rises.

               Fabienne is still sniffling.

               Butch goes to the closet.

               Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

               And with that, he's out the door.

               Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

                         I specifically reminded her not to 
                         forget it. "Bedside table – on the

               A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the

<b>               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER – DAY
</b>
               Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a 
               couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before 
               he goes boppin' through the front door.

<b>               EXT. ALLEY – DAY
</b>
               Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, 
               then he discreetly glances out.

<b>               EXT. STREET – BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY
</b>
               Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of 
               cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of 
               place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.  
               Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of 
               Butch's home.

               Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

               Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He 
               crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

               Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a 
               combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign 
               sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a 
               graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

<b>               EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY
</b>
               Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment 
               building. Once again, everything appears normal – the laundry 
               room, the pool, his apartment door – nothing appears 
               disturbed.

               Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. 
               He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

               Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening 
               it.

<b>               INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT – DAY
</b>
               His apartment hasn't been touched.

               He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick 
               look around. Obviously, no one is there.

               Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the 
               refrigerator.

               He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

               With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he 
               goes to the bedroom.

               His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment – neat, clean 
               and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a 
               few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue 
               of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of 
               Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

               Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On 
               the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

               He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He 
               opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting 
               down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and 
               puts them in the toaster.

               Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

               What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun 
               with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

                         Holy shit.

               He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines 
               it.

               Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

               Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to 
               the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

               Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not 
               knowing what to do.

               The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the 
               bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book 
               "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

               Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

               Vincent freezes.

               Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's 
               direction.

               Neither man opens his mouth.

               Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

               That's all the situation needed.

               Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

               MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

               Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets 
               SIMULTANEOUSLY – LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him 
               through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door 
               at the end of the bathroom.

               By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent 
               is annihilated.

               Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look 
               goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once 
               Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

               With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 
               back on the kitchen counter.

               Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

<b>               EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD – DAY
</b>
               Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the 
               courtyard...

               ...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

               ...goes through the alley...

               ...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

<b>               EXT. HONDA – DAY
</b>
               Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide 
               smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

<b>               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET – DAY
</b>
               The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his 
               apartment building.

<b>               INT. HONDA – DAY
</b>
               Butch looks out the window at his former home.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         That's how you're gonna beat 'em, 
                         Butch.  They keep underestimatin' 
                         ya.

               This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips 
               a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he 
               SINGS along with it.

               He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on 
               the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

               Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we 
               see:

<b>               THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</b>
               The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, 
               carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam 
               cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street 
               in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see 
               Marsellus clearly.

               Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front 
               of him.

               When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances 
               to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

               DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

               Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. 
               He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

               The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts 
               and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

               Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold 
               Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending 
               it up on the sidewalk.

               Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what 
               at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his 
               nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. 
               A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

<b>                                     PEDESTRIAN
</b>                         Jesus, are you okay?

               Butch look at him, spaced-out.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         I guess.

               Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS 
               gather around the body.

<b>                                     GAWKER #1

                         He's dead! He's dead!

               This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

               TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

               The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

                         maniac. He hit you and crashed into 
                         that car.

</b>                              (pointing at Butch)
                         Him.

               Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge 
               down the street, looking a shambles.

<b>                                     MARSELLUS
</b>                         Well, I'll be damned.

               The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back 
               away.

               Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

               Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward 
               him.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         Sacre bleu.

               Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, 
               shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

               He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, 
               screaming.

<b>                                     LOOKY-LOO WOMAN
</b>                         Oh my God, I've been shot!

               That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

               Marsellus RUNS after him.

               The CROWD looks agape.

               Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

               The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

               Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a 
               sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

<b>               INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP – DAY

               MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter 
               of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of 
               Butch RACES into his world.

<b>                                     MAYNARD

</b>                         Shut up!

               Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands 
               next to the door.

<b>                                     MAYNARD

               Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. 
               He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist 
               in Marsellus' face.

               The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man 
               FALLS FLAT on his back.

               Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

               Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in 
               the face.

               Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold 
               of his middle finger.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         So you like chasing people, huh?

               He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch 
               then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS 
               back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to 
               shield the splatter.

<b>                                     BUTCH

               Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a 
               pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

<b>                                     BUTCH

                         toss that gun!

               Butch does.

</b>                         Now you on top, stand up and come to 
                         the counter.

               Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he 
               gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face 
               with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

               After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on 
               the counter and moves to the telephone.

               Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily 
               watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on 
               the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

<b>                                     MAYNARD

               Marsellus passes out.

               They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are 
               two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and 
               a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are 
               unconscious.

               Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both 
               guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two 
               prisoners look up at their captors.

               Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one 
               hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in 
               his belt.

               A BUZZER buzzes.

<b>                                     MAYNARD
</b>                         That's Zed.

               Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs 
               that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

               WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed 
               inside the store.

               Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of 
               the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking 
               in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, 
               all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both 
               share at what they've gotten themselves into.

               Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even 
               more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. 
               The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is 
               a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and 
               stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a 
               long time, then says:

               Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

               Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a 
               leash.

               He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises 
<b>               THE GIMP.
</b>
               The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black 
               leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs 
               here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather 
               mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. 
               They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large 
               dog.

               Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, 
               then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, 
               then backs away.

               The Gimp gets on its knees.

</b>                         I ain't fer sure yet.

               Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, 
               miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his 
               finger going back and forth between the two.

               Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

               Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

               The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

               Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving 
               left to right, then it stops.

</b>
               After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on 
               Marsellus.

               Zed stands up.

                         room.

               Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old 
               room.

               Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the 
               misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. 
               Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and 
               Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the 
               back room, is empty.

               As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before 
               he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

                         Up!

               The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on 
               the ceiling.

<b>                                     MAYNARD
</b>                         Keep an eye on this one.

               The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into 
               Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because 
               suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

               Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath 
               the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history 
               of comedy.

               From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

</b>                         Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight

               We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

                         Good, I like to fight!

               Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, 
               hurriedly struggles to get free.

               The Gimp is laughing wildly.

               The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

               The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

<b>                                     MAYNARD (O.S.)

                         hold 'em!

               Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite 
               easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it 
               were never connected by a bolt.

               The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

<b>                                     THE GIMP
</b>                         Huhng?

               The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. 
               He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles 
               and grunts.

               Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S 
               PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making 
               him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash 
               attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then 
               silently makes his way through the red curtains.

<b>               INT. PAWNSHOP – DAY
</b>
               Butch sneaks to the door.

               On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected 
               to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he 
               stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their 
               way with Marsellus.

               Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in 
               a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the 
               pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in 
               with.

               He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards 
               it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks 
               about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large 
               Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots 
               what he's been looking for:

               A Samurai sword.

               It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the 
               wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. 
               Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its 
               sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten 
               in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his 
               thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not 
               on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems 
               made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the 
               sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears 
               through the red curtains to take care of business.

<b>               INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM – DAY
</b>
               Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

               Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind 
               the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

<b>               INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM – DAY
</b>
               Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It 
               swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched 
               positions.

               Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden 
               horse.

               Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

               Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up 
               behind him with the sword.

               Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, 
               red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see 
               Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         Hey hillbilly.

               Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

               Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across 
               the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on 
               Zed.

               Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

               Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword 
               behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing 
               the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

               Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go 
               from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, 
               which lies within reach.

               Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

<b>                                     BUTCH
</b>                         You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.

               Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

               Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

               Zed studies Butch.

               Butch looks hard at Zed.

               Then a VOICE says:

<b>                                     MARSELLUS (O.S.)
</b>                         Step aside, Butch.

               Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, 
               holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

<b>               KABOOM!!!!
</b>
               Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

               Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the 
               used shotgun shell.

               Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

               Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

               Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has 
               the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys 
               with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES 
               to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.

               Fabienne starts to cry.

               Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the 
               bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her 
               hand.

                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the

               We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in 
               earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except 
               this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The 
               Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard 
               to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly 
               CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

                         of charity and good will, shepherded 
                         the weak through the valley of

<b>               BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

               The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the 
               back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow 
               fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough 
               to stick their head through that door.

               Then he listens to them talk.

               The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES 
               out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his 
               hand cannon.

               DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

               He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion 
               crosses his face.

<b>               TWO SHOT – JULES AND VINCENT

               Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, 
               none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. 
               Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're 
               as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, 
               they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

               The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's 
               bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

               The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits 
               down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs 
               it off.

               Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

                         Did you see that gun he fired at us? 
                         It was bigger than him.

                         Take the body, stick it in the trunk. 
                         Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty 
                         domesticated house. That would lead 
                         me to believe that in the garage or

</b>                         Good. What I need you two fellas to 
                         do is take those cleaning products 
                         and clean the inside of the car. And 
                         I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You 
                         need to go in the backseat, scoop up 
                         all those little pieces of brain and 
                         skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe 
                         down the upholstery – now when it 
                         comes to upholstery, it don't need 
                         to be spic and span, you don't need 
                         to eat off it. Give it a good once 
                         over. What you need to take care of 
                         are the really messy parts. The pools 
                         of blood that have collected, you 
                         gotta soak that shit up.  But the 
                         windows are a different story.  Them 
                         you really clean. Get the Windex, do 
                         a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to 
                         raid your linen closet. I need 
                         blankets, I need comforters, I need 
                         quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker 
                         the better, the darker the better. 
                         No whites, can't use 'em. We need to 
                         camouflage the interior of the car. 
                         We're gonna line the front seat and 
                         the backseat and the floor boards 
                         with quilts and blankets. If a cop 
                         stops us and starts stickin' his big 
                         snout in the car, the subterfuge 
                         won't last. But at a glance, the car 
                         will appear to be normal.  Jimmie – 
                         lead the way, boys – get to work.

               The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving 
               Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

               Vincent exits for the restroom.

               Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin

               Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the 
               table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it 
               out, COCKING IT.

               Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While 
               Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them 
               terrified.

               Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from 
               the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter 
               with a trash bag in his hand.

                         just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?

               Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his 
               .45 ready to spit under the table.

               Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, 
               briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more 
               respectful, him manner more on guard.

               Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, 
               Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

               Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the 
               gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the 
               hammer.

               This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard

               Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to 
               Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. 
               Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across 
               the room, can't see shit.

               Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering 
               the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to 
               pick up the case.

               Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of 
               Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand 
               comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 
               hand under Pumpkin's chin.

               Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

               Pumpkin looks at him.

               Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

               Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

                         me nervous.  When I get nervous, I 
                         get scared. And when motherfuckers 
                         get scared, that's when motherfuckers

                         So let's see what we can do.
                              (to Ringo)
                         Now this is the situation. Normally 
                         both of your asses would be dead as 
                         fuckin' fried chicken. But you 
                         happened to pull this shit while I'm 
                         in a transitional period. I don't 
                         wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. 
                         But I'm afraid I can't give you the 
                         case. It don't belong to me. Besides, 
                         I went through too much shit this 
                         morning on account of this case to 
                         just hand it over to your ass.

               Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

               Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at

               with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

</b>                         There's a passage I got memorized. 
                         Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the 
                         righteous man is beset on all sides 
                         by the inequities of the selfish and 
                         the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is 
                         he who, in the name of charity and 
                         good will, shepherds the weak through 
                         the valley of the darkness. For he 
                         is truly his brother's keeper and 
                         the finder of lost children. And I 
                         will strike down upon thee with great 
                         vengeance and furious anger those 
                         who attempt to poison and destroy my 
                         brothers. And you will know I am the 
                         Lord when I lay my vengeance upon 
                         you." I been sayin' that shit for 
                         years.  And if you ever heard it, it 
                         meant your ass. I never really 
                         questioned what it meant. I thought 
                         it was just a coldblooded thing to 
                         say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped 
                         a cap in his ass. But I saw some 
                         shit this mornin' made me think twice. 
                         Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're 
                         the evil man. And I'm the righteous 
                         man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the 
                         shepherd protecting my righteous ass 
                         in the valley of darkness. Or is 
                         could by you're the righteous man 
                         and I'm the shepherd and it's the 
                         world that's evil and selfish.  I'd 
                         like that. But that shit ain't the 
                         truth. The truth is you're the weak. 
                         And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But 
                         I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to 
                         be a shepherd.

               Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

               Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to 
               Yolanda.

               She looks back.

               Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the 
               door.

               Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, 
               takes a sip of coffee.

                         It's cold.

               He pushes it aside.

               Vincent appears next to Jules.

</b>                         That's probably a good idea.

               Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the 
               briefcase.

               Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the 
               Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes 
               – wearing UC Santa Cruz and "I'm with Stupid" tee-shirts, 
               swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics – walk out of 
               the coffee shop together without saying a word.

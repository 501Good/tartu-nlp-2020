    "### Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have already guessed from the name, a pipeline is a set of processors combined together to form a chain. A user puts their input from one end of the pipeline and gets the desired output from the other end. As a real-life example, you may think of a water filter. It contains different materials like sand, rocks or charcoal to filter out various elemets from the water and/or add some additional healthy components. So, you give the filter a dirty water as an input and get a clean one enriched with healthy elements as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we will use [StanfordNLP pipeline](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanfordnlp/index.html). I recommend this system because it is easy to install and use, it works at a reasonable speed and produces quite accurate results. The least is proven by the results of the [CoNLL 2018 Shared Task](https://universaldependencies.org/conll18/results.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we start working with it, we need to analyse our data and treat it accordingly."

    "To give you some idea on the possible project topics, I used the same Pulp Fiction script and fine-tuned a [GPT-2 model](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2) on it. In short, GPT-2 is a language model pretrained on a large amount of texts. It can be used in various tasks, one of which is text generation. The model can generate scaringly real-looking texts given a small hand-written context. You can use this model to fine-tune it with your custom text data and in only about 15-20 minutes of training, the model already starts to produce believeable texts. \n",
